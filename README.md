# Binary-Classification-using-Sampling-methods
In this code the dataset is firstly oversampled to balance dataset.
Then 5 sampling techniques i.e Simple random sampling, Stratified Sampling, CLuster sampling, Systematic sampling and multi-stage sampling are used.
Then 5 models are applied to every 5 samples to find the maximum accuracy.
The maximum accuracy is acquired in Random Forest classifier using stratified and systematic samples.
